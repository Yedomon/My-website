      "description": "I am from Benin, a western African country. I have got a Master of Science degree in plant pathology and crop protection from the University of Cheikh Anta Diop of Dakar. I am currently doing a Ph.D. at Jeonbuk National University in the Republic of South Korea. My previous work focused on the identification of promising pearl millet genotypes that harbour resistance against downy mildew [Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) J. Schr√∂t., (1886)]. Now I am working in plant genomics domain with a focus on high-quality genome construction of both wild and cultivated sesame. My work is highly dominated by bioinformatics. I love playing with the programming languages such as perl, java with a great interest on R.",
