```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

When working with the multiple-sequences fasta files, I need to split the file and use each of them for multiple sequence alignment purposes. Therefore, the following `awk` based script is very helpful to complete this task.


```

cat your_file.fasta | awk '{
        if (substr($0, 1, 1)==">") {filename=(substr($0,2) ".fasta")}
        print $0 > filename }'


```


In this small script the `substr` function was employed to return the header name from after each `>` symbol and print the sequence with its corresponding name.
